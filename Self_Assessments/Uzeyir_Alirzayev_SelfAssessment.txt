In this project, I was able to lead a few key parts. 
First, I wrote ai.py, which makes use of the Gemini API to pull in additional details about CVE IDs. 
This involved writing good prompts and parsing through all of the responses from the API effectively. 
I also wrote scraper.py, which interacts with both the MITRE and NVD APIs to scrape and process data on different CVEs. 
In so doing, I was able to learn about the management and protection of API keys. 
Last but not least, I worked on exploit.py and, through Selenium, web-scraped Exploit DB to pull relevant information on the given CVE IDs about exploits.

The project contributed a lot to developing my skills in API integration and web scraping. 
I learned how to keep sensitive information secure and how to ensure reliable data extraction. 
Collaboration with the team was integral, involving clear communication and coordination to ensure everything fit perfectly into one piece. 
This has been one of the most pronounced contributors to my growth in both technical and teamworking skills.
