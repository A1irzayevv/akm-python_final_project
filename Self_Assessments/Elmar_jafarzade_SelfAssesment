In the CVE parser project, my primary role was to contribute ideas and share them with the team to help shape the direction of the project. I identified mistakes in the implementation and provided solutions to improve the quality of the work. One of my key responsibilities was testing CVE IDs, especially focusing on rejected or outdated CVE numbers (such as CVE-1999-0001), and applying necessary adjustments to the codebase.

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in problem identification, testing (particularly with historical data), and frontend development, while contributing to a positive and collaborative team environment.

And then we worked together with my friends on website design. I checked all the answers and identified the errors. I developed myself in html css python programming languages.

My collaboration with the team was strong, and I maintained good communication to ensure ideas were clearly shared and implemented effectively. On the frontend, I contributed ideas and worked on CSS and JavaScript to enhance the user interface and functionality, improving both the visual presentation and user experience.
