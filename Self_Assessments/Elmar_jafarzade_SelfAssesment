I checked the bugs of the project as a tester and made registrations. And then I told this to my other teammates and together we repaired these gaps. And then we worked together with my friends on website design. I checked all the answers and identified the errors.
this teamwork has given me a lot of knowledge in this field and increased my skills of working with a team. I developed myself in html css python programming languages
